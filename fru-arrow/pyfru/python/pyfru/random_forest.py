        ----------

class RandomForestClassifier(_RandomForestBase):
    """
    Random Forest Classifier implementing a fast multi-thread implementation of
    the original Random Forest model [1]_. Thanks to the Arrow PyCapsule interface,
    Pyfru supports a wide range of DataFrame libraries. In addition to prediction,
    it supports out-of-bag (OOB) predictions and feature importance. The importance
    measure is computed in a novel, efficient way.

    Parameters
    ----------
    trees : int
        Number of trees to grow in the forest (often called ``ntree`` in other
        software). Must be greater than zero. The value should be large enough
        to provide stable results (prediction accuracy or importance). Larger
        datasets typically require more trees. Computation time grows linearly
        with the number of trees. Defaults to 500.
    tries : int | None
        Number of features to try at each split (often called ``mtry``).
        Must be greater than zero and less than or equal to the number of features.
        By default, it is set to the rounded square root of the number of features.
        Higher values increase correlation between trees. In most cases, the default
        setting is recommended.
    save_forest : bool
        If ``True``, the fitted forest is stored and can be used for prediction
        or serialization. Set to ``False`` when only importance or OOB results
        are needed. Defaults to ``True``.
    calculate_importance : bool
        If ``True``, feature importance is calculated. Defaults to ``False``.
    oob : bool
        If ``True``, out-of-bag predictions are calculated. Defaults to ``True``.
    seed : int | None
        Seed used by the algorithm. Set to ``None`` to use a random seed.
    threads : int | None
        Number of threads to use. Must be greater than zero. If ``None``, all
        available CPU cores are used. Defaults to ``None``.
    Notes
    -----
    The Random Forest Classifier selects the best feature at each split using
    Gini impurity. For numerical features, the threshold is optimized by an
    exhaustive scan. The threshold is the midpoint between
    adjacent values. In case of ties, the smaller threshold is chosen.

    Ordered categorical variables are currently treated as categorical. Variables
    with six or more levels are treated as integers. Variables with five or fewer
    levels are split by exhaustively evaluating all possible partitions into two
    subsets using the Gini criterion.

    The maximum tree depth is fixed at 512. A leaf is created when the sample size
    reaches one. Leaves may also be formed earlier if no valid split is found; in
    such cases, ties are broken randomly.

    Pyfru uses its own PRNG, the pcg32 method by Melissa E. O'Neill [2]_, to provide
    reproducible results in parallel settings. For a given input and seed, the same
    trees are built regardless of the number of threads, although their order may
    differ. OOB predictions and importance scores are therefore consistent up to
    numerical precision.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : Arrow PyCapsule | None

        Returns

        Voting in classification may result in ties. In such cases, a PRNG is

        structure stored in the object. This may take time for large data or

        Number of trees to grow in the forest (often called ``ntree`` in other

    Notes
    -----
    The Random Forest Regressor selects the best feature at each split using
    variance reduction. For numerical features, the threshold is optimized by
    an exhaustive scan. For float features, the threshold is the midpoint between
    adjacent values; for integer features, it is the smaller of the two values.
    In case of ties, the smaller threshold is chosen.

    Ordered categorical variables are currently treated as categorical. Variables
    with six or more levels are treated as integers. Variables with five or fewer
    levels are split by exhaustively evaluating all possible partitions into two
    subsets using the variance reduction criterion.

    The maximum tree depth is fixed at 512. A leaf is created when the sample size
    reaches four. This means regression typically requires at least ten samples
    to be practical.

    Pyfru uses its own PRNG, the pcg32 method by Melissa E. O'Neill [4]_, to provide
    reproducible results in parallel settings. For a given input and seed, the same
    trees are built regardless of the number of threads, although their order may
    differ. OOB predictions and importance scores are therefore consistent up to
